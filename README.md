# Piano Hero

Piano Hero is a desktop application that teaches you piano by telling the user when he needs to press which key in an intuitive way.

The purpose of this application is to proof that you can learn music using common devices and technology. It also serves as a base for other programmers/designers/musician to build an application upon it.

## Getting Started

Before you start the application, you need to setup your microphone to ensure you have a good experience.

1) Press windows key + r

makes this screen appear:

2) Then you write "control mmsys.cpl sounds" this wordsi nside that new window. This should be the result:

3) Make sure it's set as default device and default communication device. Once it is, a green circle with a tick inside should appear like this:

4) Next, go to recordings, right click on your default microhpone and select properties:

5) Once inside, make sure your settings are similar to this. Don't worry if you don't have a second slider. Some microhpones don't have that option.

And you are done!


### Prerequisites

You will need a microphone. The application is made with the intent that it has to work with almost every microhpone regarding it's quality. Obviously, the higher the quality, the better.

You will also need a piano clost to your computer display so you can see the screen while you play.

The piano must be close to the microhpone too so it registers correctly the sound.

### Installing

You can install the application by going in to the release folder of this github repository and download the last release. [Release Link](https://github.com/joseppi/PitchDetection/releases)

## Acknowledgments

* There are few people that without their help, this project could've not been possible.
* Jesus he was my mentor during the development of the app. Althought audio processing was not his strongest suit, he still gave me feedback in to how to improve the application and make it better for everyone from a prespective that I couldn't grasp from where I was.
* David was the teacher that guide me during all the audio process coding and optimization. He fixed many, if not all, coding related problems but also knew when to stop to let me figure out things my way.
* All the testers that gave me their time to make the application with a better user experience with very little changes.
